WE UPLOADED SRS,SDD,PROJECT PPT AS FILES IN GITHUB


NOTE FOR EVALUATION:
‚ö†Ô∏è GITHUB UPLOAD ISSUE (Important for Evaluation)
While uploading our project to GitHub, we encountered the following issue:

‚ùå "File exceeds GitHub‚Äôs 25MB limit"
GitHub restricts individual file sizes to a maximum of 25MB. Our trained machine learning model files (.pkl and .keras) exceeded this limit.

‚úÖ How We Solved It
We used Git Large File Storage (Git LFS) to upload large model files.

If you're cloning this repository and notice missing model files:

Make sure Git LFS is installed on your system. You can install it from https://git-lfs.com.

Then run:
git lfs install
git lfs pull

üß∞ Backup Option
To avoid evaluation delays:

We can also provide a Google Drive link or a ZIP file containing the complete project (including model files).

Please contact us if model files are missing or you face difficulty running the project.
